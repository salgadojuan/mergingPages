# mergingPages
Using JavaFX to switch scenes with a click of a button for a tattoo scheduler app. 
Worked as a team to develop an app. This page-merging prototype was the first bug in our project and the goal was to ensure that the JavaFX code was able to change scenes. Password masking and other credentials of the user was not fully implemented as this codign section was just a sandbox situation to debug the issue of not being able to switch scenes. 
MVC (model, view, controller) model was implemented for this prototype.
